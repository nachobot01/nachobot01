### Hi there ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**nachobot01/nachobot01** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on learning coding to develop web GIS projects
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, ESRI Arcade
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any basic tasks as I learn 
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ArcGIS API for Javascript
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about anything. I love the insects, plants, wetlands and everything outdoors.
- ğŸ“« How to reach me: Hmm, I'll have to get back to this item later.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I lack of programming knowledge is egregious.
