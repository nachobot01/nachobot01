### Hi there 👋

- 🔭 I’m currently working on learning coding to develop web GIS projects
- 🌱 I’m currently learning HTML, CSS, Javascript, ESRI Arcade
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on any basic tasks as I learn 
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with ArcGIS API for Javascript
- 💬 Ask me about anything. I love the insects, plants, wetlands and everything outdoors.
- 📫 How to reach me: Hmm, I'll have to get back to this item later.
- ⚡ Fun fact: My lack of programming knowledge is egregious.
